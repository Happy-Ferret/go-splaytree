# go-splaytree

Splay tree in Go.

[Splay trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splay_tree)
are self-balancing binary search trees.
Accessing a node in the tree causes it and its neighbours
to be splayed upwards by means of rotations.
Future accesses to this node or to its neighbours will then be cheaper.
Splay trees perform best when there is temporal or spatial
[locality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locality_of_reference)
in the access patterns (insertions, lookups or removals).

##References

"Performance Analysis of BSTs in System Software"
[link](http://benpfaff.org/papers/libavl.pdf) by Ben Pfaff
compares 20 variants of BSTs and concludes that splay trees
performs best when accesses are sequential or clustered.
